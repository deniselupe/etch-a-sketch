## Final Thoughts
This is the first project in my journey to learning programming. I am proud of how much I have been able to make possible for this Etch-a-Sketch with the limited knowledge I've obtained so far for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 

I created an Etch-a-Sketch that met the minimum requirements for The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project), but I challenged myself by adding requirements of my own for this project. Anytime I had successfully added one feature, I found myself asking questions like *"What if I can make the grid do this? What if I can make the grid do that?"* and as a result, I had to learn about the different ways that I could make these features come to life using vanilla JavaScript and Object-oriented programming concepts.

One of the biggest challenges I've come across while working on this project was ensuring that I was writing clean, easy-to-follow, DRY code. The number of lines in my code started to grow as the list of feature requirements grew bigger. To clean my code I had first ensured that my code reflected the best practices documented in AirBnB's JavaScript style guide. I then took steps to reduce the number of duplicate lines by creating methods and an Object constructor. 

I have cleaned the code to the best of my ability with the knowledge I have obtained so far. For now, I am moving forward in my curriculum for The Odin Project, but I would like to come back to this repository in the future to see what other changes I can make to clean the code even more.
